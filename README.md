Project name: Do It

Description: App which helps users manage their time and organize not only their personal schedules, but also tasks at work together with their teammates. A lot of the times I found myself using tools that would help with organizing and managing my time, but I never found an app that would contain all of them in one. Therefore, I have decided to develop an app where you can create and manage tasks, use a pomodoro timer which is a well-known time management technique, create groups and share tasks there, receive statistics regarding how much you have progressed and also get an overview of previous and upcoming tasks. 

Requirements:
